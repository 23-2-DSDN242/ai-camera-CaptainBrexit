## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This assignment was hard for me, certainly more so than the first two assignments. I'm not a super creative person, i've never been great at coming up with ideas, or describing or visualising the ideas i can come up with. The first assignment we had a base to go off; something that could visually function as a clock. Compared to some of the other projects i saw, my radar idea was probably about as close to a clock as i could get without just making a clock. The second assignment was more picking an idea and turning that into a font, which in my case was extremely simple, just black likes and white negative space. 

For this assignment, having to come up with not only the AI algorithm but also the photos our algorithm would run on made the creative process a lot harder for me, mainly because i'm terrible at visualising how different mediums can be combined, in this case how overlaying a photograph with more basic geometry would appear. I spent a long time trying to find photos i would enjoy applying my AI algorithm to, but at the time of picking my photos, i was still using the code examples from nuku, and i hadn't decided which of them i wanted to base my own algorithm off. I really liked the pixel filter example, but all my photos were of a single person standing against a detailed background, and ony blurring the person looked pretty plain and boring. I really liked the scan mask and pixel blending examples, and in the end i decided to try use some pictures of my character from one of the games i play, destiny, and then combining the scan mask and pixel blending filters to turn the output image into a sort of 'heads-up display', similar to the one found in destiny. However, i couldnt find a way to combine the two filters, so I ended up just trying to adjust the scan mask example to draw an outline of the character, rather than highlight every pixel of them. This turned out to be a lot harder than i expected too, as i couldnt find a simple way to get the first and last pixel of the character on every line and only highlight those two, instead of every pixel of the character on that line. In the end, i just decided to pull some ideas from destiny and some of the symbolism found within the game, mainly the conflict between 'light and dark', where light and its related themes/things are represented with light colours and circles, while dark is represented with dark colours and triangles. I spent a lot of time trying to find smart ways to show this opposition through both the pictures and my algorithm, and in the end i found a pretty basic method that im at least not unhappy with, although i wouldnt say im thrilled with the results either. Adding a small border of black to the background triangles and white to the circles mgive the resulting images more contrast between the character and everything else.

I realise my problems with this assignment stem from me being bad at coming up with ideas, and it is definitely something i need to work on, but i'd say that out of the three assignments in this course, this was the one i both found the hardest and enjoyed the least.
